The HTTP protocol includes its own mechanisms for authenticating users using various authentication schemes, including the following:

 - Basic is a simple authentication mechanism that sends user credentials as a Base64-encoded string in a request header with each message.

 - NTLM is a challenge-response mechanism and uses a version of the Windows NTLM protocol.

 - Digest is a challenge-response mechanism and uses MD5 checksums of a nonce with the userâ€™s credentials.


it is relatively rare to encounter these authentication protocols being used by web applications deployed on the Internet. 

They are more commonly used within organisations to access intranet-based services.
